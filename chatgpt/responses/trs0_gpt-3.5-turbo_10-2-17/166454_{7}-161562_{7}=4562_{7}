To subtract these two numbers, we first align them by place value:

\[
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
 & & 1 & 6 & 6 & 4 & 5_{7} \\
- & & 1 & 6 & 1 & 5 & 6_{7} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, we can perform the subtraction:

$4_{7}$ (borrow 1)

$15_{7} - 6_{7} = 3_{7}$

$4_{7} - 5_{7}$ (borrow 1)

$14_{7} - 5_{7} = 6_{7}$

$1_{7} - 1_{7} = 0_{7}$

$1_{7} - 1_{7} = 0_{7}$

The final result is $503_{7}$.

\[
166454_{7}-161562_{7}=503_{7}
\]
