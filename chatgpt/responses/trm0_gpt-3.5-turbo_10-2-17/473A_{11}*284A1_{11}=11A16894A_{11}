To multiply emplate grid: 

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\phantom{+}473A_{11} \\
\times \phantom{0}284A1_{11} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

${A} \times{1} = {A}$ in base 11. Therefore the product of ${A}$ and ${1}$ in base 11 is equivalent to ${A}$.

Adding $473A_{11}$ four times (each shifted one position to the left due to the multiplication by $2$) and adding once with $473A_{11}$ without shifting.

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\phantom{+}4 \times 473A_{{11}} \\
+ \phantom{0}473A_{{11}} \\
\hline
2261AA_{11}
\end{array}
$$
Therefore, $473A_{11} \times 284A1_{11} = 2261AA_{11}$.
