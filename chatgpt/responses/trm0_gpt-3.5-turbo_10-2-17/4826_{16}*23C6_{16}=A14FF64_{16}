To compute this, we can first convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimal and then perform multiplication:

$4826_{16} = 18,630_{10}$

$23C6_{16} = 9,990_{10}$

$18,630_{10} * 9,990_{10} = 186,093,930_{10}$

Converting the result back to hexadecimal:

$186,093,930_{10} = 1 1C9D 51A_{16}$

Therefore, $4826_{16} * 23C6_{16} = 1 1C9D 51A_{16}$.
