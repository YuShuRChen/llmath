To add the two decimal numbers 38232 and 14315, follow these steps:

1. Align the numbers by their rightmost digits and add each corresponding pair of digits from right to left, carrying over any value greater than 9.

```
  38232
+ 14315
-------
  52547
```

Here's the intermediate step-by-step addition:

- Units place: 2 + 5 = 7
- Tens place: 3 + 1 = 4
- Hundreds place: 2 + 3 = 5
- Thousands place: 8 + 4 = 12 (write down 2 and carry over 1 to the next place)
- Ten-thousands place: 3 + 1 + 1 (carried over) = 5

Thus, the sum is 52547.

So, \( 38232_{10} + 14315_{10} = 38232_{10} + 14315_{10} = 52547_{10} \).
