To solve 18A35_{11} + 13A30_{11}, we'll convert each number from base 11 to base 10, perform the addition in base 10, and convert the result back to base 11.

First, let's convert 18A35_{11} to base 10:
- The digit '1' in base 11 (thousands position) has a value of \( 1 \times 11^4 \)
- The digit '8' in base 11 (hundreds position) has a value of \( 8 \times 11^3 \)
- The digit 'A' in base 11 (tens position) has a value of \( 10 \times 11^2 \) (since A = 10 in decimal)
- The digit '3' in base 11 (units position) has a value of \( 3 \times 11^1 \)
- The digit '5' in base 11 (ones position) has a value of \( 5 \times 11^0 \)

Let's calculate each of these:
\[
1 \times 11^4 = 1 \times 14641 = 14641
\]
\[
8 \times 11^3 = 8 \times 1331 = 10648
\]
\[
10 \times 11^2 = 10 \times 121 = 1210
\]
\[
3 \times 11^1 = 3 \times 11 = 33
\]
\[
5 \times 11^0 = 5 \times 1 = 5
\]

Adding these up:
\[
14641 + 10648 + 1210 + 33 + 5 = 26537
\]

Now, let's convert 13A30_{11} to base 10 using the same method:
- The digit '1' in base 11 (thousands position) has a value of \( 1 \times 11^4 \)
- The digit '3' in base 11 (hundreds position) has a value of \( 3 \times 11^3 \)
- The digit 'A' in base 11 (tens position) has a value of \( 10 \times 11^2 \) (since A = 10 in decimal)
- The digit '3' in base 11 (units position) has a value of \( 3 \times 11^1 \)
- The digit '0' in base 11 (ones position) has a value of \( 0 \times 11^0 \)

Let's calculate each of these:
\[
1 \times 11^4 = 1 \times 14641 = 14641
\]
\[
3 \times 11^3 = 3 \times 1331 = 3993
\]
\[
10 \times 11^2 = 10 \times 121 = 1210
\]
\[
3 \times 11^1 = 3 \times 11 = 33
\]
\[
0 \times 11^0 = 0 \times 1 = 0
\]

Adding these up:
\[
14641 + 3993 + 1210 + 33 + 0 = 19877
\]

Now we add the two base 10 results together:
\[
26537 + 19877 = 46414
\]

Next, we need to convert 46414 back to base 11. We do this by repeatedly dividing by 11 and taking the remainder.

\[
46414 \div 11 = 4210, \text{ remainder } 4
\]
\[
4210 \div 11 = 382, \text{ remainder } 8
\]
\[
382 \div 11 = 34, \text{ remainder } 8
\]
\[
34 \div 11 = 3, \text{ remainder } 1
\]
\[
3 \div 11 = 0, \text{ remainder } 3
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get:
\[
46414_{10} = 31884_{11}
\]

So, the sum 18A35_{11} + 13A30_{11} = 31884_{11}.

To summarize:
\[
18A35_{11} + 13A30_{11} = 26537_{10} + 19877_{10} = 46414_{10} = 31884_{11}
\]
