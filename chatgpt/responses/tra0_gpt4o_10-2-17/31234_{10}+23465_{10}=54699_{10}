Let's first compute the sum of the two given decimal numbers.

\[
31234_{10} + 23465_{10}
\]

Start by aligning the numbers by their units place and perform the addition.

\[
\begin{array}{r}
31234 \\
+ 23465 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We add column by column from right to left:

- Units place: \(4 + 5 = 9\)
- Tens place: \(3 + 6 = 9\)
- Hundreds place: \(2 + 4 = 6\)
- Thousands place: \(1 + 3 = 4\)
- Ten thousands place: \(3 + 2 = 5\)

Thus, the sum is:

\[
54699_{10}
\]

Summarizing the steps: 
\[ 31234_{10} + 23465_{10} = 54699_{10} \]
