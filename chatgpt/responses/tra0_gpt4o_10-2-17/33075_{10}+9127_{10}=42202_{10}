Let's perform the addition of the two decimal numbers step-by-step:

```
   33075
 +  9127
 --------
```

First, align the numbers by their least significant digit:

```
   33075
 +  09127
 --------
```

Now add the numbers starting from the least significant digit:

1. Units place: 5 + 7 = 12 (write 2 and carry over 1)
2. Tens place: 7 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 10 (write 0 and carry over 1)
3. Hundreds place: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 2 (write 2)
4. Thousands place: 3 + 9 = 12 (write 2 and carry over 1)
5. Ten-thousands place: 3 + 1 (carry) = 4

Thus, the result is:

```
   33075
 +  9127
 --------
   42102
```

So, \( 33075_{10} + 9127_{10} = 42102_{10} \).
