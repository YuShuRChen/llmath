To solve the binary addition of \(1100001000110_2\) and \(1001111001001101_2\), we first need to align both numbers by their least significant bits (rightmost digits).

Aligning the two binary numbers:
```
   00001100001000110
+  1001111001001101 
-------------------
```

We then perform binary addition from right to left, remembering that:
- \(0 + 0 = 0\)
- \(1 + 0 = 1\)
- \(0 + 1 = 1\)
- \(1 + 1 = 10\) (which means write down 0 and carry over 1)
- \(1 + 1 + 1 = 11\) (which means write down 1 and carry over 1)

Following these rules, let's add the numbers:

```
   00001100001000110
+  0001001111001001101 
-------------------
  001011111110110011
  (result written from lower order to higher order bits)
```

That's the binary result. You can double-check it by converting both binary numbers to decimal, adding them, and converting back to binary.

Let's verify by converting both binary numbers to decimal:

1. \(1100001000110_2 \):
\[
1 \cdot 2^{12} + 1 \cdot 2^{10} + 1 \cdot 2^5 + 1 \cdot 2^2 = 4096 + 1024 + 32 + 4 = 5156
\]

2. \(1001111001001101_2 \):
\[
1 \cdot 2^{15} + 1 \cdot 2^{14} + 1 \cdot 2^{13} + 1 \cdot 2^{10} + 1 \cdot 2^9 + 1 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1 = 32768 + 16384 + 8192 + 1024 + 512 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 58801
\]

Add the decimal equivalents:

\[
5156 + 58801 = 63957
\]

Finally, convert \(63957\) back to binary:

\[
63957_{10} = 1111100111000101_2
\]

So, adding the two binary numbers \(1100001000110_2\) and \(1001111001001101_2\) results in:

\[
1100001000110_2 + 1001111001001101_2 = 1111100111000101_2
\]

**Summary**:
\[
1100001000110_2 + 1001111001001101_2 = 1111100111000101_2
\]
