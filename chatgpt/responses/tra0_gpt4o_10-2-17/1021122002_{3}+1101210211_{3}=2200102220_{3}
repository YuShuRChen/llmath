Let's add the numbers \(1021122002_3\) and \(1101210211_3\) in base 3.

First, align the numbers vertically for addition:
```
  1021122002_3
+ 1101210211_3
  -----------
```

We add them column by column from right to left, ensuring we handle any carries appropriately in base 3.

```
Column 1: 2 + 1 = 3 -> 10 in base 3 (write 0, carry 1)
Column 2: 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 2 -> 2 in base 3 (no carry)
Column 3: 0 + 2 = 2 -> 2 in base 3 (no carry)
Column 4: 2 + 0 = 2 -> 2 in base 3 (no carry)
Column 5: 2 + 1 = 3 -> 10 in base 3 (write 0, carry 1)
Column 6: 1 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 4 -> 11 in base 3 (write 1, carry 1)
Column 7: 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 3 -> 10 in base 3 (write 0, carry 1)
Column 8: 2 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 3 -> 10 in base 3 (write 0, carry 1)
Column 9: 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 3 -> 10 in base 3 (write 0, carry 1)
Column 10: 1 + 1 (carry) = 2 -> 2 in base 3 (no carry)
```

Write the result down and combine it together:

```
Carry:      1111
1021122002
+1101210211
 -----------
  21210202010_3
```

Therefore, the sum of \(1021122002_3\) and \(1101210211_3\) is \(21210202010_3\).

\[
1021122002_{3} + 1101210211_{3} = 21210202010_{3}
\]

Summary: \(1021122002_3 + 1101210211_3 = 21210202010_3\)
