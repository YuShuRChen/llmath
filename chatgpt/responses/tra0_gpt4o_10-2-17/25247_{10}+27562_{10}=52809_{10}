To solve the addition in base 10, we simply add the two decimal numbers directly:

\[ 25247_{10} \]
\[+27562_{10} \]
\[ \text{-----------} \]

Starting from the rightmost digit:
- Units place: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \)
- Tens place: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \), write down 0 and carry over 1.
- Hundreds place: \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) plus the carry over 1 gives \( 7 + 1 = 8 \)
- Thousands place: \( 5 + 7 = 12 \), write down 2 and carry over 1.
- Ten-thousands place: \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) plus the carry over 1 gives \( 4 + 1 = 5 \)

So, the result is:

\[ 52809_{10} \]

Equation and steps summarized:

\[ 25247_{10} + 27562_{10} = 52809_{10} \]
