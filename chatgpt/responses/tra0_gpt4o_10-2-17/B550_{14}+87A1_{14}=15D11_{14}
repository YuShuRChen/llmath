Let's compute the sum of the two numbers B550_{14} and 87A1_{14} in base 14. We begin by converting each number to base 10.

### Step 1: Convert B550_{14} to base 10
B550_{14} = B*14^3 + 5*14^2 + 5*14^1 + 0*14^0

Here B in base 14 is equivalent to 11 in base 10.
So we have:
= 11*14^3 + 5*14^2 + 5*14^1 + 0

Calculating each term:
= 11 * 14^3
= 11 * (14^2 * 14)
= 11 * (196 * 14)
= 11 * 2744
= 30184

= 5 * 14^2
= 5 * 196
= 980

= 5 * 14^1
= 5 * 14
= 70

= 0 * 14^0
= 0

Adding these together:
= 30184 + 980 + 70 + 0
= 31234

So, B550_{14} in base 10 is 31234_{10}.

### Step 2: Convert 87A1_{14} to base 10
87A1_{14} = 8*14^3 + 7*14^2 + A*14^1 + 1*14^0

Here A in base 14 is equivalent to 10 in base 10.
So we have:
= 8*14^3 + 7*14^2 + 10*14^1 + 1

Calculating each term:
= 8 * 14^3
= 8 * (14^2 * 14)
= 8 * (196 * 14)
= 8 * 2744
= 21952

= 7 * 14^2
= 7 * 196
= 1372

= 10 * 14^1
= 10 * 14
= 140

= 1 * 14^0
= 1 * 1
= 1

Adding these together:
= 21952 + 1372 + 140 + 1
= 23465

So, 87A1_{14} in base 10 is 23465_{10}.

### Step 3: Add the two numbers in base 10
31234_{10} + 23465_{10} = 54699_{10}

### Step 4: Convert the sum 54699_{10} back to base 14

Let's break it down step by step using the largest power of 14 that fits into the number:
54699 / 14^4 = 54699 / 38416 ≈ 1 (remainder 54699 - 38416 = 16283)
16283 / 14^3 = 16283 / 2744 ≈ 5 (remainder 16283 - 5 * 2744 = 5563)
5563 / 14^2 = 5563 / 196 ≈ 28 (2* 14^2 fit exactly, thus 28/14 equals 2)
(so, remainder fit exactly here 5563 - 392)
(you will see that shifting it larger/smaller would have no additional value for it here)

The exact fit would be:
(1 * 14^4) + (5 * 14^3) + (2 * 14^2) here give us our appropriate remaining:
Rest can be solved iteratively.
= 1 * 14^4 + 5*14^3 + 2*14^2 + 3*14^1 + 7*14^0 adding each exact simplify remaining to respective combine.
Thus,= 1D02B

So, we get the final conversion:
respective step will give value = (1 * 14^4) + (0 * 1...)

**Summary:** B550_{14} + 87A1_{14} = 31075_{15}
