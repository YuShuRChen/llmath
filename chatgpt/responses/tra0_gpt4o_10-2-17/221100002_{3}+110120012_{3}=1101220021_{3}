To add the numbers in base 3, follow these steps:

1. Align the numbers by the least significant digit:

```
221100002_{3}
+110120012_{3}
```

2. Add the digits in each column from right to left, carrying over as needed (since weâ€™re in base 3).

Let's add starting from the rightmost digit:

- **Rightmost column:**
  \[
  2 + 2 = 4
  \]
  Since 4 in base 3 is \(4_{10} = 1*3^1 + 1*3^0 = 11_3\), we write 1 and carry over 1.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  0 + 1 + 1 \text{ (carry)} = 2
  \]
  No carry.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  0 + 0 = 0
  \]
  No carry.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  0 + 2 = 2
  \]
  No carry.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  0 + 1 = 1
  \]
  No carry.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  1 + 0 = 1
  \]
  No carry.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  1 + 1 = 2
  \]
  No carry.

- **Next column:**
  \[
  2 + 1 = 3
  \]
  \(3_{10} = 10_3\), so we write down 0 and carry over 1.

- **Leftmost column:**
  \[
  2 + \text{(carry)} 1 = 3
  \]
  \(3_{10} = 10_3\), so we write down 0 and carry over 1.

  Since there are no more digits to add, we simply bring down the carry-over to the final result.

The final sum is 
```
1001001101_{3}
```

Summarized in one line:
\[
221100002_{3} + 110120012_{3} = 1001001101_{3}
\]
