First, we will simply add the two decimal numbers together:

\[ 18470_{10} + 9158_{10} \]

Let's align the numbers by their digits and add them column-wise:

```
  18470
+  9158
-------
```

Starting from the rightmost digit:
- 0 + 8 = 8
- 7 + 5 = 12 (write down 2, carry over 1)
- 4 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 6
- 8 + 9 = 17 (write down 7, carry over 1)
- 1 + 1 (carry) = 2

Summing these up gives us:

\[ 18470_{10} + 9158_{10} = 27628_{10} \]

To summarize:
18470_{10} + 9158_{10} = 27628_{10}
