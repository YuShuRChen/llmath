We need to add the binary numbers \(110011110101001_2\) and \(100110110100101_2\).

First, align the numbers by their least significant digits:

```
  110011110101001
+ 100110110100101
```

Add each column, noting any carries:

- Starting from the right:
    - 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
    - 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1 (no carry)
    - 0 + 0 = 0 (no carry)
    - 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
    - 0 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 1 (no carry)
    - 1 + 0 = 1 (no carry)
    - 1 + 1 = 0 (carry 1)
    - 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 (carry 1)
    - 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0 (carry 1)
    - 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 1 (carry 1)
    - 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0 (carry 1)
    - 0 + 1 + 1 (carry) = 0 (carry 1)
    - 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) = 0 (carry 1)
    - 0 + 1 (carry) = 1 (no carry)
    - 1 (carry) = 1 (final)

Here's the addition with carries:
```
           1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
     110011110101001
+    100110110100101
-------------------
  1011011101001110
```

Thus, the result of the addition is \(1011011101001110_2\).

Summarizing:
\(110011110101001_2 + 100110110100101_2 = 1011011101001110_2\)
