First, we align the numbers:

\[
\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & & 4 & 4 & 4 & 3 & 4_{6} \\
+ & & 5 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 4 & 1_{6} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Adding the numbers in base 6:

$4_{6} + 1_{6} = 5_{6}$

$3_{6} + 4_{6} = 11_{6}$, which is written as $1$ carry $1$ in base 6

$4_{6} + 3_{6} + 1_{6} = 13_{6}$, which is written as $1$ carry $2$ in base 6

$4_{6} + 1_{6} + 2 = 11_{6}$, which is written as $1$ carry $1$ in base 6

$4_{6} + 1_{6} + 1 = 6_{6}$, which is written as $1$ carry $1$ in base 6

$5_{6}$

Therefore, $44434_{6} + 511341_{6} = 155050_{6}$.
