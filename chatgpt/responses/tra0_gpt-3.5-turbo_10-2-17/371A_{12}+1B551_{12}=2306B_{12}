First, we need to convert both numbers to base 10 to perform the addition:

371A_{12} = 3*12^3 + 7*12^2 + 1*12^1 + 10*12^0 = 5182_{10}
1B551_{12} = 1*12^4 + 11*12^3 + 5*12^2 + 5*12^1 + 1*12^0 = 19321_{10}

Now, we can add these two numbers in base 10:

5182_{10} + 19321_{10} = 24503_{10}

Finally, we convert the result back to base 12:

24503_{10} = 1431B_{12}

Therefore, 371A_{12} + 1B551_{12} = 1431B_{12}.
