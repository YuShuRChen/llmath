First, write the numbers in base 10:
\[33506_{10}\]
\[31845_{10}\]

Next, perform the subtraction:
\[33506 - 31845\]

Start by subtracting the ones place:
\[6 - 5 = 1\]

Next, subtract the tens place:
\[ 0 - 4 \]

Since 0 is smaller than 4, we borrow 1 from the hundreds place:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Next, subtract the hundreds place, remembering that we borrowed 1, so we have:
\[ 4 - 1 = 3 \]

Now, subtract the thousands place:
\[ 3 - 8 \]

Since 3 is smaller than 8, we borrow 1 from the ten thousands place:
\[ 13 - 8 = 5 \]

Finally, subtract the ten thousands place, remembering that we borrowed 1:
\[ 3 - 3 = 0 \]

Therefore, the result of the subtraction:
\[ 33506 - 31845 = 1661 \]

So:
\[ 33506_{10} - 31845_{10} = 1661_{10} \]
