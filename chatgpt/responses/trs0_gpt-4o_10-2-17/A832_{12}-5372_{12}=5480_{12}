To subtract these base-12 numbers, let's first ensure that we understand the digits in base-12. In base-12, digits range from 0 to 11, with 10 and 11 typically represented as 'A' and 'B', respectively.

Here's the step-by-step subtraction:

1. **Align the numbers:**
   ```
     A832_{12}
   - 5372_{12}
   ```

2. **Start Subtraction from the least significant digit (rightmost):**

   - Subtract '2' from '2':
     ```
     2_{12} - 2_{12} = 0_{12}
     ```
   
   - Subtract '7' from '3':
     We need to borrow since 7 is greater than 3. Borrow 1 (which is 12 in decimal) from '8' making it '7' and '3' become 15 in base 12 (since 3 + 12 = 15 in base 10, and converting 15 back to base-12 results in 13).
     ```
     15_{12} - 7_{12} = 8_{12}
     ```

   - Subtract '3' from '7':
     ```
     7_{12} - 3_{12} = 4_{12}
     ```

   - Subtract '5' from 'A':
     Convert 'A' to 10 in decimal.
     ```
     10_{12} - 5_{12} = 5_{12}
     ```

So, the result of the subtraction is:
```
  5830_{12}
```

Final answer:

A832_{12} - 5372_{12} = 5830_{12}
