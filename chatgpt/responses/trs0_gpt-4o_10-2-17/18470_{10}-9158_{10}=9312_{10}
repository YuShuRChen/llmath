First, let's perform the subtraction given in base 10:

\[
18470_{10} - 9158_{10}
\]

Step-by-step subtraction:

1. Subtract the units digits: \(0 - 8\).
   Since \(0 < 8\), borrow 1 from the tens place (making 10 - 8):

   \(10 - 8 = 2\).

2. The tens place, originally \(7\), is now \(6\) due to the borrowing.
   Subtract the tens digits: \(6 - 5\):

   \(6 - 5 = 1\).

3. Subtract the hundreds digits: \(4 - 1\):

   \(4 - 1 = 3\).

4. Subtract the thousands digits: \(8 - 9\).
   Since \(8 < 9\), borrow 1 from the ten-thousands place (making 18 - 9):

   \(18 - 9 = 9\).

5. The ten-thousands place, originally \(1\), is now \(0\) due to the borrowing.

Summarize the intermediate steps:

\[
18470_{10} - 9158_{10} = 9312_{10}
\]

Thus, the result is:

18470_{10} - 9158_{10} = 9312_{10}
