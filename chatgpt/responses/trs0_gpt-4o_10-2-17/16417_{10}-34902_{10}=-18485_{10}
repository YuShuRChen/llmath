To compute the result, we subtract the second number from the first number.

\[
16417_{10} - 34902_{10}
\]

Performing the subtraction step-by-step:

1. Adjust for subtraction by borrowing if needed:
   - When subtracting units: 
     (7 - 2) = 5
   - When subtracting tens and borrowing:
     Since 1 (tens place) is less than 0, we borrow 1 from the hundreds, making it 11 - 0 = 1
     And decrease the hundreds place by 1 making it (4-1) = 3
   - Now hundreds place (between 3 and 9), we again need borrowing:
     (13 - 9) = 4, and further decreasing thousands by 1 making it (6-1) = 5
   - Next, thousands place:
     (5 - 4) = 1, and finally ten-thousands place:
     subtract (1 - 3) is required borrow from non-existing digit gives a huge negative.

Given the pattern, directly we conclude:
\(16417 - 34902 = -18485\)

Therefore, the calculated result is:
\[
16417_{10} - 34902_{10} = -18485_{10}
\]
