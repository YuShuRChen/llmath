To find the result of the subtraction $453000_{6}-150135_{6}$, let's first align the numbers vertically:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
 453000_{6} \\
-150135_{6} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Subtracting the numbers column by column:

Starting from the rightmost column:

$0 - 5$ = $0$ (as 0 is smaller and borrowing is not possible)

Moving to the next column:

$0 - 3$ = $3$

Moving to the next column:

$0 - 1$ = $5$ (as we need to borrow from the next column - considering 6 as the base)

The next column:

$3 - 0$ = $3$

The next column:

$5 - 5$ = $0$

The leftmost column:

$4 - 1$ = $3$

Therefore, $453000_{6}-150135_{6}=303315_{6}$

\textbf{Final Answer:} $453000_{6}-150135_{6}=303315_{6}$
