To subtract two numbers in base 11:

Carry out borrowing whenever necessary and then subtract each digit column by column.

Converting 6976_{11} to base 11: 

6976_{11} =  6*11^3 +  9*11^2 + 7*11^1 + 6*11^0 =  6*1331 + 9*121 + 7*11 + 6 = 7986_{10}

12971_{11} - 7986_{10} =  12971_{11} - 7986_{11}

Adding leading zero to 7986_{11} to align the columns:

12971_{11}
-07986_{11}

Starting with the rightmost column:

1 - 6 = -5 
Carry over 1 from the next column.
11 + 2 - 8 = 5
4 - 9 = -5
Carry over 1 from the next column.
11 + 9 - 7 = 13
1 - 0 = 1
Carry over 1 from the next column.
1 - 0 = 1
Carry over 1 from the next column.
1 - 0 = 1

Combining these results, we obtain  5991_{11} as the final result.

Therefore, 12971_{11} - 6976_{11} = 5991_{11}.
