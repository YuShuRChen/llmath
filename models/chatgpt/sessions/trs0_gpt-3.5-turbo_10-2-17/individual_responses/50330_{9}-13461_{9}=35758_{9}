To subtract these two numbers, we need to perform the operation in base 9:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\phantom{+}50330_9 \\
- \phantom{+}13461_9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to borrow from the next higher digit since 0 cannot be subtracted from 1 in base 9:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\phantom{+}50320_9 \\
- \phantom{+}13461_9 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Performing the subtraction in each digit:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\phantom{+}50320_9 \\
- \phantom{+}13461_9 \\
\hline
\phantom{+}36451_9
\end{array}
\]

Therefore, \(50330_{9} - 13461_{9} = 36451_{9}\)
