To subtract 35462 from 104564 in base 7, we first need to perform borrowing:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
 & 1 & 0 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 4_{7} \\
- & & 3 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 2_{7} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

When subtracting in base 7:
$4 - 2 = 2$, $6 - 4 = 2$, $5 - 6$ requires borrowing from the next digit, so we have $15 - 6 = 1$ with $1$ carried over to the next column, $4 - 5$ requires borrowing, so we have $14 - 5 = 6$ with $1$ carried over, $0 - 3$ requires borrowing, so we have $10 - 3 = 4$.

Therefore, $104564_7 - 35462_7 = 42122_7$.
