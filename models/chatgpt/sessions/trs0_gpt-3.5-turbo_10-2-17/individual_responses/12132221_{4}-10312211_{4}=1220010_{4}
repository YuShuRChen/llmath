To solve this equation, let's subtract the two numbers in base 4.

First, let's align the two numbers:
```
   12132221
-  10312211
------------
```

Now, let's perform the subtraction:
```
          1
   12132221
-  10312211
------------
     155010
```

Therefore, the result of the equation \(12132221_4 - 10312211_4\) is \(155010_4\).
