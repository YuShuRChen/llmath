To calculate \(33506_{10} + 31845_{10}\):

1. Align the numbers by the decimal point.

\[
\begin{array}{r}
33506 \\
+31845 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

2. Add the digits column by column from right to left, carrying over when needed:

 \[
\begin{array}{r}
\quad\ \  1 \\
33506 \\
+31845 \\
\hline
65351 \\
\end{array}
\]

Let's break it down:
- Units place: \(6 + 5 = 11 \ \text{(write 1, carry 1)}\)
- Tens place: \(0 + 4 + 1 = 5 \ \text{(write 5, no carry)}\)
- Hundreds place: \(5 + 8 = 13 \ \text{(write 3, carry 1)}\)
- Thousands place: \(3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \ \text{(write 5, no carry)}\)
- Ten thousands place: \(3 + 3 = 6 \ \text{(write 6, no carry)}\)

Therefore, the sum is \(65351_{10}\).

Summarized answer: 
33506_{10} + 31845_{10} = 65351_{10}.
