To add numbers in base 7, we need to carry over when the sum exceeds 6.

Starting from the rightmost column:
$4_{7} + 2_{7} = 6_{7}$ with no carry over.

Moving to the next column:
$5_{7} + 6_{7} = 13_{7} = 6_{7}$ with a carry over of 1.

Moving to the next column:
$4_{7} + 1_{7} + 1 = 6_{7}$.

Therefore, $166454_{7} + 161562_{7} = 325016_{7}$.
