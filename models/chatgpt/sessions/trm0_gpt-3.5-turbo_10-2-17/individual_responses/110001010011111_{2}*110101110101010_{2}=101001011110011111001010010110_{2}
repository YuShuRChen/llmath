To multiply two binary numbers, we perform binary multiplication as follows:
```
                110001010011111_{2}
          Ã—     110101110101010_{2}
          _______________________
                110001010011111_{2}  (First row, shifted 0 bits)
           +   00000000000000000       (Second row, shifted 1 bit)
          +    11000101001111100       (Third row, shifted 2 bits)
+         11000101001111100             (Fourth row, shifted 3 bits)
         +    11000101001111100        (Fifth row, shifted 4 bits)
    +      11000101001111100           (Sixth row, shifted 5 bits)
 _________________________________
              100110011111000101100
```
Therefore, 110001010011111_{2}*110101110101010_{2}=  100110011111000101100_{2}.
