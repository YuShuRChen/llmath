Let's perform the subtraction:

\[
25247_{10} - 27562_{10}
\]

First, we align the numbers by their place values:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
25247 \\
-27562 \\
\end{array}
\]

Next, we subtract each digit from right to left, borrowing where necessary:

1. Units place: \(7 - 2 = 5\)

2. Tens place: \(\text{Since } 4 - 6 \text{ is not possible, we borrow from the hundreds place.}\)

    \[
    4+10-6 = 14-6 = 8
    \]

3. Hundreds place: \(\text{Since we borrowed 1 already (making it effectively 1-1=0), the subtraction becomes } 1 - 5\text{. So we need to borrow from the thousands place:}\)

    \[
    1+10-5 = 11-5 = 6
    \]

4. Thousands place: \(\text{After borrowing 1 (making it effectively 51-10), the subtraction becomes } 4 - 7\text{. So we borrow from the ten-thousands place:}\)

    \[
    4+10-7 = 14-7 = 7
    \]

5. Ten-Thousands place: \(\text{After borrowing, it becomes effectively} 2-1 = 1-2 = -1.\text{ This indicates going negative/underflow.} \times)

After correctly accounting for the borrows and remembering about all carried borrow modeling correctly precision we finally solve result soundly as we're cancelling smaller from bigger anyhow.:

Thus the calculation goes soundly via placeholder walking thrugh precision in final straightforward as barely:

    \(
    -315 \implies actual borrowing).

Thus sumuing up again to finalize comprehension craft.
