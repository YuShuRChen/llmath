First, let's perform the subtraction directly as it's straightforward with both numbers in base 10.

Start by aligning the numbers:
```
  38232
- 14315
---------
```

Now, subtract each digit from right to left:
```
  38232
- 14315
---------
  23917
```

So the result of \( 38232_{10} - 14315_{10} \) is \( 23917_{10} \).

Summarizing: \( 38232_{10} - 14315_{10} = 23917_{10} \)
