To compute the product of 165300₇ and 35416₇, we first need to convert both of them from base 7 to base 10, perform the multiplication in base 10, and then, if required, convert the result back to base 7.

Let's start by converting 165300₇ to base 10.

165300₇ = 1 * 7⁵ + 6 * 7⁴ + 5 * 7³ + 3 * 7² + 0 * 7¹ + 0 * 7⁰

Calculating the powers of 7 we need:
- 7⁰ = 1
- 7¹ = 7
- 7² = 49
- 7³ = 343
- 7⁴ = 2401
- 7⁵ = 16807

Now, substituting these values:
1 * 16807 + 6 * 2401 + 5 * 343 + 3 * 49

Calculate step-by-step:
- 1 * 16807 = 16807
- 6 * 2401 = 14406
- 5 * 343 = 1715
- 3 * 49 = 147

Add them up:
16807 + 14406 + 1715 + 147 = 33075

So, 165300₇ is 33075₁₀.

Next, let's convert 35416₇ to base 10.

35416₇ = 3 * 7⁴ + 5 * 7³ + 4 * 7² + 1 * 7¹ + 6 * 7⁰

Using the same powers of 7:
- 3 * 2401 = 7203
- 5 * 343 = 1715
- 4 * 49 = 196
- 1 * 7 = 7
- 6 * 1 = 6

Add them up:
7203 + 1715 + 196 + 7 + 6 = 9127

So, 35416₇ is 9127₁₀.

Multiply the two base 10 numbers:
33075 * 9127

First, approximate the multiplication to ensure the next steps are in the right range:
33075 * 9127 = 301,741,725 (intermediate step)

Now, let’s perform precise multiplication:
33075 * 9127 = 301,726,125

Now we need to convert 301,726,125 (base 10) back to base 7. This involves repeated division by 7 and keeping track of the remainders:

Let's perform the division:

301726125 ÷ 7 = 43103732 remainder 1
43103732 ÷ 7 = 6157676 remainder 0
6157676 ÷ 7 = 879667 remainder 5
879667 ÷ 7 = 125666 remainder 5
125666 ÷ 7 = 17952 remainder 2
17952 ÷ 7 = 2564 remainder 4
2564 ÷ 7 = 366 remainder 2
366 ÷ 7 = 52 remainder 2
52 ÷ 7 = 7 remainder 3
7 ÷ 7 = 1 remainder 0
1 ÷ 7 = 0 remainder 1

Reading the remainders from last to first, we get: 10322455201₇

So, the final result is:
165300₇ * 35416₇ = 10322455201₇
